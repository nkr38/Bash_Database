```
% 
```

#Commands
```

  Break out of your input loop, quit the program
setdb
  Set the filename for the databse file
add
  Add or update an item to (int) the database
delete
  Remove an item from the database
printdb

```
If the command is not recognised, respond with:

Unrecognised command.

Otherwise, dispatch the command to an appropriate handler.

quit

Signal quit . Extra arguments are ignored.

setdb
setdb <db>
Set current database to be be <db> .

If the file exists and is readable, make the file the current database, respond with:
Database set to <db>
If the file exists but is not readable, do not update the current database, respond with
File <db> not readable
If the file does not exist, your script will create the empty named file and respond
File <db> created. Database set to <db>
If no filename is supplied, respond with:
Missing Argument
If too many arguments are supplied, respond with:
Extra arguments ignored
, then consider the first argument as the filename, proceed as above.

Note: You are not required to handle quotes or backslashes. You don't need to worry about escaped characters. E.g., you are not responsible for filenames with spaces.

However, your script should be able to handle a full path filename, such as /home/user/cs265/A2/db.txt

add
add <product> <price>
If the database has not been set by a previous setdb command, your script must respond
Database has not been set.
If there are not two arguments, respond with:
Incorrect syntax.
Otherwise, process the update:
If the <product> does not already exist, append a new line
<product>:<price>
to the database, and respond to stdout:

<product>:<price> has been added to the database
  
If the <product> exists, update it the with the new <price> respond with
<product> has been updated to <price>

delete
delete <product>
If the database has not been set by a previous setdb command, your script must respond
Database has not been set.
If there is not ! one argument, respond with:
Incorrect syntax.
If the product does not exist in <db>, your script must respond
<product> does not exist in `<db>`.
Otherwise, the script must delete the corresponding line from <db> and respond
<product> has been deleted from `<db>`.

printdb
If the database has not been set by a previous setdb command, your script must respond
Database has not been set.
Ignore any arguments
If the database is set, then pretty-print all the lines from the database
  Product      Price
------------  -------                                                                                                   
Reever        $  3.25
Thingabob     $121.64
Marlinespike  $ 12.37

If the database has been set, the script should print all lines from the database.
