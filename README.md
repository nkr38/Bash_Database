# Bash_Database

Assignment â€” Bash DB
CS 265 Advanced Programming Techniques
Overview
You will create an interactive utility called prod_list which maintains a simple database (a flat text file), as described below
You will write this in Bash
You can use Sed or AWK in your script, use any of the filters and other utilities we've discussed, but you may not invoke a program written in Python, PERL, etc.
Your program will continue to accept input until the user signals quit
Develop your script on the Drexel CS servers (tux.cs.drexel.edu)
Test that your script correctly implements the required functionality
What to Do
When invoked, display the following prompt:

(Note the space after the prompt.)

Requirements
After startup, the script should repeatedly perform these steps, until quit is signalled:

Print a prompt consisting of a percent sign followed by a space
% 
To allow the user to enter input on the same line as the prompt, consider printf , or echo -n.

Read a line from standard input
Dispatch the command to the appropriate handler
Consider the left-most token to be the command
Maybe pass the arguments to a function written for each command
Note, the quit signal will probably be handled specially
Commands
quit
Break out of your input loop, quit the program
setdb
Set the filename for the databse file
add
Add or update an item to (int) the database
delete
Remove an item from the database
printdb
Print all the lines from the database
If the command is not recognised, respond with:

Unrecognised command
. Otherwise, dispatch the command to an appropriate handler.

quit
quit
Signal quit . Extra arguments are ignored.

setdb
setdb <db>
Set current database to be be <db> .

If the file exists and is readable, make the file the current database, respond with:
Database set to <db>
If the file exists but is not readable, do not update the current database, respond with
File <db> not readable
If the file does not exist, your script will create the empty named file and respond
File <db> created. Database set to <db>
If no filename is supplied, respond with:
Missing Argument
If too many arguments are supplied, respond with:
Extra arguments ignored
, then consider the first argument as the filename, proceed as above.

Note: You are not required to handle quotes or backslashes. You don't need to worry about escaped characters. E.g., you are not responsible for filenames with spaces.

However, your script should be able to handle a full path filename, such as /home/user/cs265/A2/db.txt

add
add <product> <price>
If the database has not been set by a previous setdb command, your script must respond
Database has not been set.
If there are not two arguments, respond with:
Incorrect syntax.
Otherwise, process the update:
If the <product> does not already exist, append a new line
<product>:<price>
to the database, and respond to stdout:

<product>:<price> has been added to the database
If the <product> exists, update it the with the new <price> respond with
<product> has been updated to <price>
HINT: Consider using sed or AWK for implementing the update.

delete
delete <product>
If the database has not been set by a previous setdb command, your script must respond
Database has not been set.
If there is not ! one argument, respond with:
Incorrect syntax.
If the product does not exist in <db>, your script must respond
<product> does not exist in `<db>`.
Otherwise, the script must delete the corresponding line from <db> and respond
<product> has been deleted from `<db>`.
HINT: Again you can look at sed or AWK for implementing the delete.


printdb
If the database has not been set by a previous setdb command, your script must respond
Database has not been set.
Ignore any arguments
If the database is set, then pretty-print all the lines from the database
  Product      Price
------------  -------                                                                                                   
Reever        $  3.25
Thingabob     $121.64
Marlinespike  $ 12.37

If the database has been set, the script should print all lines from the database.
